Here's how they failed.</h2><p class=dropcaps>On Nov. 24, 1934, retired General Smedley Butler sat before a closed session of the Congressional Special Committee on Un-American Activities in New York. Though he was a two-time Medal of Honor winner with a once unimpeachable reputation, Butler knew there were already those outlets, like the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times, who would call</a> his story a “Gigantic Hoax.”</p><p>He also knew, however, that if he said nothing the Business plot, a coup of the country’s most wealthy designed to remove President Franklin D. Roosevelt from office and replace him with a fascist regime, could only continue. Worse still, it might succeed.</p><p>“May I preface my remarks by saying, sir,” Butler <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">began</a>, “That I have one interest in all of this, and that is to try to do my best to see that a democracy is maintained in this country.”</p><p>Smedley’s testimony was ultimately dismissed. The conspirators were never prosecuted.</p><h2>Smedley Butler: An Uncommon Marine</h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-236090 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/smedley-butlers-retirement-ceremony.jpg alt="Smedley Butler's Retirement Ceremony" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-236090 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Smedley Butler at his 1931 retirement ceremony.</span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Born</a> to a Quaker family in 1881 Pennsylvania, Smedley Butler would rise from an underaged 16-year-old soldier in Cuba to one of the most well-respected military men in the United States.</p><p>Butler rose to Major General in the Marine Corps through his service in the Boxer Rebellion and across Central America before accepting his commission in the First World War.</p><p>As the commander of a fort in northern France, Butler oversaw the care of more than two million men and earned a reputation as someone who understood the common man. Following the Armistice in 1918, he had accepted command at a Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia and waded into politics and criticism of President Hoover. Naturally, the president grew to dislike Butler.</p><p>Butler finally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">retired</a> in 1931 when the president snubbed him by giving the role of Commandant of the Marine Corps to a less senior officer.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-232215 alt="WWI Victory Parade" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WWI-Victory-Parade.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-232215 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Victory parade celebrating the end of World War I. 1919.</span></p><p>It was just as well, by this time, Hoover’s presidency was riddled with problems.</p><p>At the end of World War I, more than three million American troops had returned from “the war to end all wars” in various states of disarray. The veterans were without support in an era before the official recognition of post-traumatic stress disorder, the Veterans Affairs Bureau, or anything resembling a GI bill.</p><p>In 1919, most veterans had received $60 in mustering pay and a train ticket home for their trouble. The American Legion organization was consequently established to serve as a veterans’ union to increase their bargaining power in government and petition for aid.</p><p>In 1924, these efforts resulted in the passage of the War Adjusted Compensation Act, which promised World War I veterans bonus pay for their lost wages in the form of a bond that would be collectible after 20 years in 1945.</p><p>This had seemed like a reasonable compromise at first.

He said wasn’t sure what he would say, or how so many struggling veterans were supposed to get to Chicago. MacGuire said his organization, the Committee for Sound Currency, had already written him a speech and produced bank statements for over $110,000, which is just under two million by today’s standards, “for expenses.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-232227 alt="American Legion Article" width=900 height=552 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/American-Legion-Article.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-232227 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>American Legion Digital Archives</span><span class=caption-body>Excerpt from American Legion guide article to 1933 convention.

Davis, who was 1924’s Democratic Presidential Candidate, former Ambassador to the U.K., and current legal counsel to J.P. Morgan and Company.</p><p>Davis, MacGuire continued, was an associate of his direct employer who was also a soldier, financier Colonel M.P. Murphy. The “why,” MacGuire said, was very simple. They just wanted to make sure that the veterans received their bonuses with real, not “rubber” money.</p><p>MacGuire offered Butler checks from Murphy and another man named Robert S. Clark as a down payment to help get the necessary gang together.</p><p>Butler knew both of these men from back in the Boxer Rebellion. He also knew that Murphy was a multi-millionaire and had been one of the biggest backers of the American Legion’s founding, fronting $125,000 — so why would one of the Legion’s founders want him to overthrow their leadership?</p><h2>Robert Clark’s Offer</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-232210 alt="American Legion Convention" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Legion-Convention-1922.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-232210 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>American Legion Convention, 1922.</span></p><p>Robert S. Clark had served under Butler in China known as the “millionaire lieutenant,” a young heir to the Singer Sewing Machine fortune. Now, he was a settled and successful financier.</p><p>When in New Jersey for a speaking engagement, MacGuire surprised Butler at his hotel to once again ask about gathering soldiers and giving a speech.</p><p>Butler, frustrated, said he didn’t believe that MacGuire actually had the money. The banker pulled $18,000 in thousand-dollar bills from his wallet and threw them onto Butler’s bed. Insulted, Butler said he was tired of dealing with middlemen. He demanded to speak with Robert Clark himself.</p><p>MacGuire agreed.</p><p>Just before the American Legion Convention in Miami that September, Clark traveled by train to his old commander’s home. The pair caught up, reminisced about the Boxer Rebellion, and then got down to business.</p><p>Clark reiterated the same pitch about gathering soldiers and getting back to the Gold Standard. Butler said it didn’t add up. Finally, the former officer came clean.</p><p>According to Butler, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clark told him that</a> he had a fortune of $30 million.

Roosevelt was from a rich family. He swam in the same circles as the conspirators. The president would have the backing of some very powerful friends, and so would Butler if he played along.</p><p>The retired general said he didn’t like seeing soldiers used as pawns to undermine democracy.

A new Secretary of General Affairs, one who would replace the Secretary of State and leave the President to “dedicate bridges and kiss children.”</p><p>For the first time, Butler understood what MacGuire wanted.

But, he’d known since the break-up of the Bonus Army that MacArthur would never be as esteemed as Smedley Butler would be to the veterans.</p><p>MacGuire estimated that in all, they’d only need an army of about 500,000.</p><p>The general asked how they intended to pull all this off or even pay for it. MacGuire explained that the group would be announcing its presence publicly in the next few weeks. He wasn’t sure which name they’d settled on yet, but between the collaborators, they might have as much as $300 million to commit to “protecting the constitution.”</p><p>That is more than $5 billion in 2019 currency.</p><p>Whether Butler agreed or not, MacGuire said, once they got in touch with the right members of the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign wars and acquired weaponry, it was only a matter to time until their plot was successful.

Mussolini had proved strangely popular in the American media over the last decade. The press was similarly hopeful about Hitler.</p><p>In July, Fortune Magazine had run <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an editorial which asked</a> “whether Fascism is achieving in a few years of decades such a conquest of the spirit of man as Christianity achieved only in ten centuries.”</p><p>The article went on, “the good journalist must recognize in Fascism certain ancient virtues of the race, whether or not they happen to be momentarily fashionable in his own country. Among these are Discipline, Duty, Courage, Glory, Sacrifice.”</p><p>Butler decided to call a friend at the VFW and warn him about what he’d been hearing. As it turned out, there were other, similar rumors floating around.</p><p>Without proof, the conspiracy was not necessarily anything more than just a rumor.</p><h2>The Conspirators Make Their Move</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-232208 alt="FDR With Conspiracy Plotters" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FDR-Davis-Smith.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-232208 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>FDR (second from left) with accused conspirators John W.

If he went public with his accusations, people might think it was a publicity stunt. He needed more than his own word to inform the government.</p><p>So, he reached out to a journalist from the Philadelphia Record, Paul French, who agreed to help him collect evidence.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-236144 alt="Paul French Writing At A Desk" width=894 height=670 data-sizes="(max-width: 894px) 100vw, 894px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/paul-french-writing-at-desk.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-236144 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Paul French of the Philadelphia Record, to whom Smedley Butler broke the story of the Business Plot.</span></p><p>French determined that ALL member Irenee Dupont, who would later do business with the Nazis well into World War II, owned a controlling stake in Remington-Colt which possibly provided the group with access to artillery.</p><p>Other members of ALL included Al Smith, former governor of New York and 1932 democratic presidential hopeful and turned rival of President Roosevelt; as well as other men whose connections ran back to the Klu Klux Klan and Pro-Nazi groups within the United States.</p><p>As the New York Post put it, “The brood of anti-New Deal organizations spawned by the Liberty League are in turn spawning Fascism.”</p><h2>Collecting The Evidence And Exposing The Truth</h2><p>To build more evidence, Butler introduced French to MacGuire as a like-minded friend.

In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.”</p><p>Butler spent the rest of his life trying to draw attention to the ties between big business and the American military. A strident isolationist is his last years, Butler died of pancreatic cancer in June 1940. He was 58.</p><h2>Alternate Explanations For The Business Plot?</h2><p>In the decades since, doubters have asked why, if the scheme was real, didn’t President Roosevelt aggressively pursue it?</p><p>Would it have been wise for the president to allow a group of openly treasonous fascist sympathizers to continue to operate in Washington? On the other hand, if there was such a group, what could Roosevelt have done about it anyway?</p><p>Perhaps the best explanation on the matter to come from Roosevelt came in 1936 when he reaccepted the nomination of the Democratic Party.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking just after he defeated American Liberty League-backed rivals, Roosevelt <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">declared</a>:</p><p>“For out of this modern civilization economic royalists carved new dynasties. New kingdoms were built upon concentration of control over material things. Through new uses of corporations, banks, and securities, new machinery of industry and agriculture, of labor and capital — all undreamed of by the fathers — the whole structure of modern life was impressed into this royal service…It was natural and perhaps human that the privileged princes of these new economic dynasties, thirsting for power, reached out for control over Government itself. They created a new despotism and wrapped it in the robes of legal sanction. In its service, new mercenaries sought to regiment the people, their labor, and their property.
