We are revisiting this interview, which was originally published in August of 2019, in commemoration of his life.</p><p class=clay-paragraph_drop-cap data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5n5i3004h1py6utv24cmi@published data-word-count=151>Speed couldn’t kill Joel Schumacher, and neither could AIDS nor brutal Batman & Robin reviews, so his personal trainer apparently did his best to finish him off with a brutal workout. On a recent Wednesday, the 79-year-old director, sitting in a chair in his Greenwich Village loft, is unable to get up and not entirely certain he’ll live to see Thursday. “It was a leg day yesterday,” he says woefully. “Oh my God, it hurts so much. The glutes.” But, per usual, Schumacher, reliable survivor, will survive. “I know what leg injuries are,” he says. “I was a runner for 30 years. I’ve had skiing accidents. When you’re a very active person and you make movies, shit will happen to you. What I say to film schools is making movies is not all blow jobs and sunglasses. Every shot is grunt work. And happily, there’s nothing I would have rather done.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbof001b3a668nfbn6my@published data-word-count=182>Schumacher was able to do what he loved for an extraordinary stretch, directing 25 features of diverse genres from 1974 to 2011, when his last film was released, the violent Nicolas Cage–Nicole Kidman thriller Trespass, a movie that, like the majority he made, didn’t exactly test the capacity of Rotten Tomatoes’ review meters. But Schumacher was always a hardy Hollywood organism, never paralyzed long by bad reviews, and for decades spared movie jail thanks to a streak of solid earners, from St. Elmo’s Fire (1985), to Flatliners (1990), to Phone Booth (2003), and a few bona fide blockbusters like Batman Forever (1995) and A Time to Kill (1996). Gen-Xers who first became aware of him as the director of 1987’s The Lost Boys may be surprised to learn that directing was in fact Schumacher’s second career, and arguably not even his most glamorous. Frédéric Tcheng’s recent documentary, Halston, in which he is featured, finds Schumacher recalling the ’60s, when he and the film’s titular fashion designer were inseparable tall drinks of water, the two coolest kids looming over the Manhattan fashion world.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbom001c3a66p429vj3t@published data-word-count=182><strong>You know and have worked with so many people that it might be easier to ask, is there anybody you don’t know?</strong><br>Well, yeah. But it was a very small community when I went out [to Hollywood]. You knew everyone. You knew the studio heads by their first names. It was a world where everyone gave dinner parties at their houses. And people were very generous in inviting me. Once a week, Sue Mengers, one of the biggest agents in Hollywood, would give a fantastic party. Barbra Streisand and Robert Evans and Ryan O’Neal — Tatum O’Neal, when she was very young — would be there. There would also be Brenda Vaccaro, who was a big star then. She was going with Michael Douglas. Michael always says, “We became friends because we were always at the dinner table with no place cards.” I was a $200-a-week costume designer, and Michael was on TV. He was the co-star of The Streets of San Francisco with Karl Malden, and TV was considered a lesser art in those days. It was Brenda who was the draw.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbop001d3a66afj7ws6t@published data-word-count=135><strong>One of your first breaks in movies was when Woody Allen hired you as a costume designer on 1973’s Sleeper. I understand you became friends and went out together a lot.</strong><br>He and Diane Keaton had broken up, and he was sort of a bachelor-around-town in New York. Many times we were both single. There was a New Year’s Eve when we took all our invitations, his and mine, and we decided we were going to go to every single party together. From a small gathering to a huge thing. That was fun. Woody taught me, at a very early stage in my career, things that have carried me. So did everyone I’ve ever worked with. All I know about Woody is he couldn’t have been a more generous friend.

What I want you to do is go back to Ireland and watch Cool Hand Luke and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest because these are guys that totally fucked with the system.

And everything in the world from the highest praise to shit like this is going to happen to you.” And she looked up at me, crying, and said, “I never needed to be this famous.” And it was so profound to me because I realized you can’t decide how much fame you want or get.

Most child actors are trained to speak in a certain way to directors that scares the shit out of you, you know, trained to do cornflake commercials. [Casting director] Mali Finn had been to nine cities and auditioned 6,000 boys. I wanted a real kid with the real accent to do this part. With Flatliners, we’d needed children to act out the sins of the young adults so we’d looked for kids with difficult childhoods. I said to Mali, “Well, what about kids that are in trouble for this?” And so she went to the police, and Brad was in trouble at 10 years old with the police already, drinking and smoking and hanging around with teenagers. Sound familiar? And his audition is un-fucking-real. It’s so brilliant. Susan Sarandon and I got him into a very good school. We did everything we could. What happened was, a lot of people took advantage of him from that moment on. Suddenly, he was a star making money.
